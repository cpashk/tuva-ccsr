### Intermediate

  - name: ccsr__dx_vertical_pivot
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
    desription: This is an intermediate model that pivots the DXCCSR's wide-format mapping CSV
      into a long format table. While the seed uses 6 columns to represent the 6 CCSR codes that
      may be present, this generates one row for each CCSR category per ICD code, so up to
      6 rows per code. 
  - name: ccsr__procedure_category_map
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
    description: This is an intermediate model that renames some PRCCSR columns to align with other TUVA
      models as well as the `ccsr__dx_vertical_pivot` model.
  
### Final

  - name: ccsr__long_condition_category
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
    description: This model contains a mapping of individual condition ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to the
      CCSR's clinically meaningful diagnosis categories. Each row represents a mapping of an ICD-10 code
      to a CCSR category. As each ICD-10 code may be mapped to up to 6 categories, it's expected
      that this table will output as many or more rows than the TUVA condition model.
      The model is equivalent to the CCSR's Output Option 1 - Vertical File Output.
    columns:
      - name: encounter_id

      - name: diagnosis_rank
      - name: ccsr_category
        description: "A CCSR category for the ICD-10-CM code. One ICD-10-CM code may have up
          6 CCSR categories associated, ordinally ranked by the ccsr_category_rank."
      - name: ccsr_category_description
        description: "The description of the CCSR category as provided in the CCSR seed file."
      - name: ccsr_category_rank
        description: "The ordinal rank of a given CCSR category mapped to an ICD-10-CM code. The
          CCSR seed CSV has the order of categories assigned to each ICD-10-CM code."
      - name: is_ip_default_category
        description: "For each ICD-10-CM code, this field will return true for the CCSR category
          that is the default value for the code if the underlying record is an inpatient encounter."
      - name: is_op_default_category
        description: "For each ICD-10-CM code, this field will return true for the CCSR category
          that is the default value for the code if the underlying record is an outpatient encounter."

  - name: ccsr__wide_condition_category
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
      enabled: "{{var('wide_condition_enabled', True)}}"
    description: |  
      This model contains a row for each input record with a column for every CCSR condition category. 
      Each column contains a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3. These values indicate:
        * 0 \- The CCSR was not triggered by any ICD-10-CM diagnosis code on the input record.
        * 1 \- The CCSR was triggered by only the principal (or first-listed) diagnosis on the input record.
        * 2 \- The CCSR was triggered by both the principal (or first-listed) diagnosis and any secondary diagnosis on the input record.
        * 3 \- The CCSR was triggered by only secondary diagnosis code(s) on the input record.

  - name: ccsr__singular_condition_category
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
    description: This model contains only the CCSR's default category assignment for the ICD-10 code,
      and only for the first-listed ICD-10 code.

  - name: ccsr__long_procedure_category
    description: This model contains a mapping of individual condition ICD-10-PCS procedure codes to the
      CCSR's clinically meaningful procedure categories. Each row represents a mapping of an ICD-10 code
      to a CCSR category. The model is equivalent to the CCSR's Output Option 1 - Vertical File Output.
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
    columns:
      - name: encounter_id

  - name: ccsr__wide_procedure_category
    config:
      tags: ccsr
      materialized: table
      enabled: "{{var('wide_procedure_enabled', True)}}"
    description: |  
      This model contains a row for each input record with a column for every CCSR procedure category. 
      Each column contains a value of 0 or 1. These values indicate:
        * 0 \- The CCSR was not triggered by any ICD-10-PCS code on the input record.
        * 1 \- The CCSR was triggered by a procedure on the input record.  
      
      While the CCSR maps to values 0-3, these values require a procedure rank, but no rank is
      included in the TUVA procedure model.
