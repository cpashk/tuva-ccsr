    description: "This model contains a mapping of individual condition ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to the
      CCSR's clinically meaningful diagnosis categories. Each row represents a mapping of an ICD-10 code
      to a CCSR category. As each ICD-10 code may be mapped to up to 6 categories, it's expected
      that this table will output as many or more rows than the TUVA condition model.
      The model is equivalent to the CCSR's Output Option 1 - Vertical File Output."
